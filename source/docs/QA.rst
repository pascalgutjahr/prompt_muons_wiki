* In the simulation we remove the electromagnetic shower component. Thus, we also remove some muons. How large is the impact of this 
to our analysis? 

* Our definition is prompt is: parent is not pion or kaon. The definiton in MCEq divides it by a minimum decay length of 
:math:`0.123\,\mathrm{cm}`. Is there a difference? 

* How do we plan to reconstruct the leading muon energy? 

* Do we want to add limited statistics to our likelihood? 

* What is the impact of limited MC statistics on our analysis currently?
