Next Steps 
##########

In this section, we list the next steps for the analysis.

Unfolding 
+++++++++

- Unblinding plans
    - Unfold 12 years of data for IC86 from 2011 to 2022
    - Determine regularization strength on data
    - Perform unfolding on data
        - Build matrix on all 4 primary models
        - Fit prompt/conv normalization (significance) on all 4 unfoldings each
        - Build average of all 4 unfoldings → nominal values
- Post-unblinding checks
    - Check the data-MC agreement for proxy variable (leading energy)
    - pre-fit (on the entire Snowstorm dataset)
    - post-fit (re-weight to fitted systematics)
    - Divide total dataset in 3 subsets á 4 years to analyze systematic impacts over the years
    - Divide dataset into 4 seasons
- Paper Proposal
    - Present status of forward folding in November
    - If results look promising → cross—checks can be done until end of January next year
        - Combined forward and unfolding paper: Discovery of prompt?
    - Elif, forward folding needs much more work
        - Unfolding paper: Measurement of muon flux
