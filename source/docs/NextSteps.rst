Next Steps 
##########

In this section, we list the next steps for the analysis.

Unfolding 
+++++++++

- Unblinding proposal:
    - Process 12 years of experimental IceCube data for IC86 from 2011 to 2022 
    - Determine regularization strength on data
    - Perform unfolding on data

- Post-unblinding checks
    - Check data-MC agreement for proxy variable (leading muon energy at entry) with the nominal MC dataset, and with the MC dataset re-weighted to the fitted ice systematics 
    - Compare unfolded flux to previous muon flux measured by Patrick Berghaus 
    - Compare unfolded flux to my previous burnsample unfolding
    - Compare unfolded flux to MCEq predictions (for all 4 primary models, and for different hadronic interaction models)
