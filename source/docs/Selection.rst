Selection 
#########

The starting point for the selection is level 2.  

- show some rates and expected energy distributions
- calculate estimated runtimes per run (8h of data)

Level 3 
+++++++

- show different filters 

To further reduce the number of events in the low energy region, a cut on the bundle energy is applied. For this, 
the efficiency as a ration of the number of events before and after the cut is calculated. The efficiency is shown for 
different zenith ranges.
