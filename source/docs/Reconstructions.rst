Reconstructions 
###############

The reconstructions for the incoming direction and the energy of the muons are machine learning based using the `dnn_reco <https://github.com/icecube/dnn_reco>`_ framework.
The performance of the reconstructions is currently under investigation. So far, we had two bachelor students Leander Flottau and Benjamin Brandt working on angular and 
energy reconstructions. Their bachelor theses are provided on request. 
The networks mentioned below are the networks used for the plots stated in the Analysis chapter. Further below, the latest networks currently under investigation 
are presented
