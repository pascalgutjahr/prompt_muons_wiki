Previous analyses 
-----------------
In the past, two analyses were performed focused on high energetic muons arising from our Earth's atmosphere by Thomasz Fuchs and Patrick Berghaus. 
In Tomasz's thesis, which included an unfolding of the energy spectrum with one year of experimental data, the analysis was limited by MC statistics. 
This caused the analysis to result in a prompt normalization that is compatible with zero. 
In Patrick's thesis, a mismatch between MC and data was found in the :math:`\cos(\theta)` distribution. This issue leads to systematic uncertainties resulting the 
final significance of the detection of the prompt component to be lower than :math:`3.5 \sigma`.
